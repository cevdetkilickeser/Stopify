# Stopify

I developed this application during my internship at Atmosware. This music application demo, which I developed with Jetpack Compose, 
is named "Stopify," though it :) offers the ability to listen to 30-second previews of songs fetched from the deezer.api service. Additionally, 
users can perform desired searches using song, artist, and album search filters. The app also allows users to add tracks to favorites, 
create personalized playlists, and download songs for offline listening.
